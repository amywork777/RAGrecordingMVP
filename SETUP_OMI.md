- **OmiAudioStreamService** - Handles audio streaming and STT processing

### UI Components  
- **OmiDevicePairing** - Device discovery and connection interface
- **OmiStreamingStatus** - Real-time streaming controls

### Integration
- **Enhanced RecordScreen** - Omi section added seamlessly
- **Multi-codec Support** - PCM16, PCM8, and Opus audio formats
- **Real-time Transcription** - Live speech-to-text with chunked processing

## üîß Technical Architecture

```
Omi Device ‚Üí Bluetooth ‚Üí Audio Stream ‚Üí Buffer (3s chunks) ‚Üí STT ‚Üí RAG-in-a-box ‚Üí UI
```

### Audio Processing Flow:
1. Omi device streams audio via Bluetooth Low Energy
2. Audio is buffered in 3-second chunks for optimal processing
3. Multiple codecs (PCM16, PCM8, Opus) are automatically converted to WAV
4. Processed through existing STT pipeline (Whisper/AssemblyAI)
5. Transcriptions sent to RAG-in-a-box for intelligent responses
6. Results displayed in familiar chat interface

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Options

### Audio Settings (in OmiAudioStreamService.ts):
```typescript
bufferDurationSeconds: 3        // Chunk size before STT processing
enableRealTimeTranscription: true  // Live transcription toggle
sampleRate: 16000              // 16kHz optimal for Omi devices  
channels: 1                    // Mono audio
```

### Connection Settings (in OmiBluetoothService.ts):
```typescript
scanTimeout: 10000             // 10 second device discovery
```

## üì± User Experience

### Device Connection
- **One-tap scanning** for Omi device discovery
- **Visual signal strength** indicators
- **Auto-connection** to previously paired devices
- **Battery level monitoring** for connected devices

### Audio Streaming
- **Start/Stop controls** with live status indicators
- **Real-time transcription** display during streaming  
- **Audio quality metrics** (data rate, codec, duration)
- **Buffer progress** visualization

### Integration with Existing Features
- **Webhook monitoring** continues during Omi streaming
- **Built-in recording** remains independent
- **Chat interface** works with all audio sources

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Omi device discovery works
- [ ] Bluetooth connection establishes successfully  
- [ ] Audio streaming starts/stops correctly
- [ ] Real-time transcription appears
- [ ] Final transcripts save to history
- [ ] Connection survives app backgrounding
- [ ] Both audio sources work independently
- [ ] UI remains responsive during streaming

## üêõ Common Issues

### Device Not Found
- Ensure Omi device is powered on
- Check Bluetooth is enabled on phone
- Try restarting the scan

### Connection Drops  
- Verify devices are within range
- Check Omi battery level
- Ensure no other apps are connected to Omi

### No Transcription
- Confirm microphone permissions granted
- Check network connectivity  
- Verify backend STT service is running

## üéØ Key Implementation Answers

### Your Original Questions:

**1. Bluetooth connection logic structure:**
- Implemented as separate service layer (`OmiBluetoothService`) using official Omi SDK
- Event-driven architecture matching existing BLE patterns
- Robust connection management with auto-cleanup

**2. Audio buffering between Omi streaming and STT:**  
- 3-second audio chunks balance latency vs. processing efficiency
- Multi-codec support with automatic WAV conversion
- Memory-efficient buffer management with automatic cleanup

**3. Robust reconnection logic:**
- Automatic connection state monitoring
- Graceful disconnect handling with user notifications
- Event-based reconnection attempts on connection loss

**4. Error handling patterns:**
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks for all Bluetooth operations
- User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance  
- Fallback behavior for network and device issues

**5. Omi audio stream integration with RAG-in-a-box:**
- Seamless integration through existing `APIService.sendAudioBase64` 
- Real-time transcription chunks processed immediately
- Final transcripts enhanced with AI-generated titles and summaries

## üéâ Ready to Go!

Your RAGrecordingMVP now has full Omi integration while preserving essential functionality. The app supports two audio input methods working independently:

1. **Built-in Recording** (preserved)
2. **Omi Devices** (new!)

Enjoy seamless voice recording and intelligent transcription! üöÄ
