# RAGrecordingMVP - Omi Bluetooth Integration

This is an enhanced version of the RAGrecording app that integrates Omi's Bluetooth functionality for seamless audio streaming and transcription. The app now supports three different audio input methods:

1. **Built-in Recording** - Direct microphone recording via the mobile app
2. **XIAO Hardware** - BLE-based file transfer from XIAO recording devices
3. **Omi Devices** - Real-time audio streaming from Omi hardware devices

## üöÄ Features

- Real-time audio transcription using Whisper/AssemblyAI
- RAG-in-a-box integration for intelligent responses
- Chat interface for interacting with transcriptions
- Webhook monitoring for external hardware recordings
- Auto-scanning for BLE devices
- Secure file storage and management

### New Omi Integration Features
- **Omi Device Discovery**: Scan for and connect to Omi Bluetooth devices

- **Connection Management**: Robust connection handling with auto-reconnection

## üîß Architecture

### Services Layer
- **OmiBluetoothService**: Manages Omi device connections using the official Omi React Native SDK
- **OmiAudioStreamService**: Handles audio buffering, processing, and STT integration
- **Existing Services**: Preserved all original BLE, Audio Recording, and API services

### UI Components
- **OmiDevicePairing**: Device discovery and connection interface

## üì± Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
1. **Expo Dev Client**: Required for BLE functionality (cannot use Expo Go)
2. **iOS/Android Device**: Physical device needed for Bluetooth testing
3. **Omi Device**: Physical Omi hardware device for testing
4. **Backend Services**: RAG-in-a-box backend must be running

### Dependencies
```bash
cd mobile
npm install
```

Key dependencies automatically installed:
- `@omiai/omi-react-native` - Official Omi SDK
- `react-native-ble-plx` - Bluetooth Low Energy support
- All existing dependencies preserved

### iOS Configuration
The app.json already includes required iOS permissions:
```json
{
  "ios": {
    "infoPlist": {
      "NSMicrophoneUsageDescription": "This app needs access to the microphone to record audio for transcription.",
      "NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription": "This app needs Bluetooth access to connect to Omi recording devices for audio streaming.",
      "NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription": "This app needs Bluetooth access to connect to Omi recording devices for audio streaming.",
      "UIBackgroundModes": ["audio", "bluetooth-central"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Android Configuration
Android permissions are pre-configured:
```json
{
  "android": {
    "permissions": [
      "android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO",
      "android.permission.BLUETOOTH",
      "android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN",
      "android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT"
    ]
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Running the App

### Development Build
```bash
# Start the development server
npx expo start --dev-client

# Build and install dev client (first time only)
npx expo run:ios
# or
npx expo run:android
```

### Production Build
```bash
# Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios

# Build for Android
eas build --platform android
```

## üéõÔ∏è Usage Guide

### Connecting Omi Devices

1. **Open the App**: Launch the RAGrecordingMVP app
2. **Access Omi Section**: In the main recording screen, find the "Omi Device" section
3. **Scan for Devices**: Tap the headset icon to expand and then tap "Scan"
4. **Connect**: Select your Omi device from the discovered devices list
5. **Start Streaming**: Once connected, tap "Start Streaming" to begin real-time audio capture

### Audio Processing Flow

```
Omi Device ‚Üí Bluetooth ‚Üí Audio Stream ‚Üí Buffer ‚Üí STT ‚Üí RAG-in-a-box ‚Üí UI Response
```

1. **Audio Capture**: Omi device streams audio via Bluetooth
2. **Buffering**: Audio is buffered in 3-second chunks for optimal processing
3. **Format Conversion**: Audio is converted to WAV format for STT compatibility
4. **Transcription**: Processed through existing STT pipeline (Whisper/AssemblyAI)
5. **RAG Integration**: Transcripts are sent to RAG-in-a-box for intelligent processing
6. **Display**: Results shown in the familiar chat interface

### Managing Multiple Input Sources

The app seamlessly handles multiple audio input sources:
- **Omi streaming** and **microphone recording** can be used independently
- **XIAO device** file transfers work alongside Omi streaming
- **Webhook monitoring** continues running for external hardware integration

## üîß Configuration

### Audio Streaming Settings

The Omi audio service can be configured in `OmiAudioStreamService.ts`:

```typescript
const streamingOptions = {
  bufferDurationSeconds: 3,        // Buffer duration before STT processing
  enableRealTimeTranscription: true, // Enable live transcription
  sampleRate: 16000,               // Audio sample rate (16kHz typical for Omi)
  channels: 1                      // Mono audio channel
};
```

### Connection Timeout Settings

Bluetooth connection timeouts in `OmiBluetoothService.ts`:

```typescript
await this.omiConnection.scanForDevices(10000); // 10 second scan timeout
```

## üß™ Testing Guide

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ RecordScreen.tsx           # Enhanced with Omi integration
```

### Key Integration Points

1. **Event System**: Omi services use the same event emitter pattern as existing BLE services
2. **STT Pipeline**: Omi audio feeds into the existing APIService.sendAudioBase64 method
3. **UI Consistency**: New components follow the same design system as existing UI
4. **State Management**: Omi state integrated into existing RecordScreen state structure

### Performance Considerations

- **Audio Buffering**: 3-second chunks balance latency vs. processing efficiency
- **Memory Management**: Audio buffers are cleared after processing to prevent memory leaks
- **Background Processing**: Audio streaming continues in background using iOS background modes

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Omi Device Not Found**
   - Ensure Omi device is powered on and in pairing mode
   - Check Bluetooth is enabled on mobile device
   - Try restarting the scan

2. **Connection Drops**
   - Check Omi device battery level
   - Ensure devices are within Bluetooth range
   - Verify no other apps are connected to the Omi device

3. **No Audio Streaming**
   - Confirm microphone permissions are granted
   - Check if Omi device supports the expected audio codec
   - Verify backend STT service is responding

4. **Transcription Issues**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify API keys for STT services
   - Ensure audio quality is sufficient (check signal strength)

### Debug Logging

Enable detailed logging by checking the console output for:
- `üîç` Bluetooth scanning events
- `‚úÖ` Connection success messages
- `üéµ` Audio streaming status
- `üìù` Transcription events
- `‚ùå` Error messages with details
